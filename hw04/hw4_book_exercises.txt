1. Yes.The program will have the same result if we have used ">" instead of ">=" in the if
   statement. The if statment in the program will test if the user's value is nonnegtive. if
   we have excluded "0" here, the program will continue to execute if we put in any positive number
   or "0", as we have initialized entry value to 0 and the while statement has already included 
   "0" to be true. 
   However, the loop will terminate if the user entered a negative value.
   
2. No, the program will just print out Sum = 0 if we use > in stead of >=. Because we have already
   initialized entry to 0, which allows the while statement to be true, and if we change ">=" to 
   ">", the while statment will not be true and cannot be executed . The loop will just display 
   the sum, which is "0". The initialization of "0" will run the body of the loop at least once.

3. If entry = int(input()) were moved out of the loop, the loop will continue collect inputs from
   from the user and cannot terminate and display the sum. Because we have initialized entry to be
   0, and in the while loop, we need to give values to "entry" to let the loop continue to run or to
   terminate. If we move the line, entry will always be "0" whatever input we have gived outside the loop, so
   the loop will never terminate and print the sum.
   No,it is not a good habit to move the assignment out because the entry needs to be checked and added
   to the result.

4. 100

5. infinite, as the condition is always true and will create an infinite loop.
